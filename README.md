# myAlert

<p style="max-width:75%; margin:auto; position:relative; width:100%; text-align:center; top:100px; font-size:14px;">myAlert is a very simple Js library that can display callout dialogs anywhere on a HTML page. It's very lightweight in its filesize and performance. The lib depends on only two other popular libs which are: jQuery & iscroll, and it is still open for other cool implementations. So, any contribution will be welcome. I hope you like it.</p>

<p>I use myAlert to create this chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jhehenajiifngcndnlecbmcdobnkeglb</p>
